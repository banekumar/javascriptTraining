// The "switch" statement
// A switch statement can replace multiple if checks.

// It gives a more descriptive way to compare a value with multiple variants.

// The syntax
// The switch has one or more case blocks and an optional default.

// It looks like this:

switch(x) {
  case 'value1':  // if (x === 'value1')
    ...
    [break]

  case 'value2':  // if (x === 'value2')
    ...
    [break]

  default:
    ...
    [break]
}

// The value of x is checked for a strict equality to the value from the first case (that is, value1) then to the second (value2) and so on.
// If the equality is found, switch starts to execute the code starting from the corresponding case, until the nearest break (or until the end of switch).
// If no case is matched then the default code is executed (if it exists).


// An example
// An example of switch (the executed code is highlighted):

let a = 2 + 2;

switch (a) {
  case 3:
    alert( 'Too small' );
    break;
  case 4:
    alert( 'Exactly!' );
    break;
  case 5:
    alert( 'Too big' );
    break;
  default:
    alert( "I don't know such values" );
}

// Here the switch starts to compare a from the first case variant that is 3. The match fails.

// Then 4. That’s a match, so the execution starts from case 4 until the nearest break.

// If there is no break then the execution continues with the next case without any checks.

// Grouping of “case”
// Several variants of case which share the same code can be grouped.

// For example, if we want the same code to run for case 3 and case 5:

let a = 3;

switch (a) {
  case 4:
    alert('Right!');
    break;

  case 3: // (*) grouped two cases
  case 5:
    alert('Wrong!');
    alert("Why don't you take a math class?");
    break;

  default:
    alert('The result is strange. Really.');
}

// Now both 3 and 5 show the same message.

// The ability to “group” cases is a side effect of how switch/case works without break. Here the execution of case 3 starts from the line (*) and goes through case 5, because there’s no break.
